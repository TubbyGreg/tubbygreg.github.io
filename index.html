                        <h2>The Man for the Job</h2>
                        <p>Never one to shy away from a challenge, 
                            I am a well motivated employee who is 
                            capable of working independently but
                             equally enjoys bringing creativity and
                              innovation to team projects. I have been
                               described as a pragmatic individual 
                               whom others can rely upon to ‘get the job done’. 
                               I am friendly, approachable and conscientious in
                                addition to being committed to helping others 
                                to achieve their goals. </p>

                    <h2>Skills, Interests and activities</h2>
                    <p>I derive immense satisfaction from playing Tuba 
                        and Bass guitar in several bands both in and 
                        out of university. Although I’ve played Bass 
                        and Tuba for 11 years, recently I’ve committed
                         to teaching myself how to play the guitar. I
                          write orchestral music in my spare time using
                           the Sibelius musical notation software; I 
                           find it both relaxing and intellectually 
                           stimulating. I am passionate about computers, 
                           and regularly build and modify PCs. I am 
                           currently teaching myself Javascript and C# 
                           in addition to the Python I already learnt in 
                           school. I am particularly skilled at cable 
                           management and continue to improve upon my 
                           case modification skills. I enjoy DIY and have
                            a good working knowledge of how to use a wide
                             range of hand and power tools.</p>
