			<h2>intro</h2>
			<p>For my website, I have a website where the product is myself. I have a homepage 
			with some content lifted from my CV. There is a contact page, and a gallery page with
			some photographs lifted from my Instagram.  The customiser is a “design your own
			hockey mask” as I love hockey and I think custom goalie masks are really well
			designed. I’ve used plenty of media, including an embedded youtube video an 
			plenty of images. I have used Local Web Storage to save and load on my 
			customiser.</p>
			<h2>Web Standards</h2>
			<p>Web standards are a set of rules and guidelines created by the world wide 
			web consortium to make the development of the code that creates websites 
			consistently. Website Builders and Browser builders both have to use these 
			standards so that everyone can use the web in the same way. HTML and CSS are 
			the two main standards set by the W3C. HTML is used to define the content of 
			the web page and CSS is used to control the layout and design. Because HTML 
			is a markup language, if you wish to create a more interactive webpage, 
			then another scripting language must also be incorporated. JavaScript 
			is perhaps the most popular of such languages and it is the one I have
			chosen to use. Client-side scripting is not as secure as server-side 
			scripting, but since no important data is being sent using my website, like
			card transactions or any personal details client-side scripting is fine. It
			has meant that my website is dynamic, instead of being static. </p>

			<p>My Website is built using HTML, CSS and some JS. There are some HTML5
			Elements, and CSS3 is used. HTML semantic elements I have used include an 
			article, header, footer, nav and section. I have used border-radius, box-shadow,
			and web-fonts and transparency on the CSS3 side.  </p>
			<h2>Interoperability</h2>
			<p>Interoperability means that the website can be used across browsers. This is 
			achieved by using the latest web standards and also responsive design using CSS.
			Doing this creates the best experience for all the potential users of the website
			by treating them all equitably. Using the following metatag:</p>
			<img alt="meta" src="Assets/meta.jpg">
			<p>I was able to make the website more usable on devices with smaller screens such
			as tablets and mobile phones.  I used media queries to make my device work well on
			certain devices with smaller screens. I set it so that with a maximum screen width
			of 799 pixels a different set of rules from the CSS is loaded.  I have used 
			relative sizing on all as many parts of my website as possible to allow the website 
			to scale smoothly across screen resolutions.</p>

			<h2>Best Practices</h2>
			<p>Using best practices makes the website easier to maintain. This would be 
			especially important if working as part of a group of developers and designers,
			say where one worked on the HTML and CSS while another worked on the JavaScript.
			Using relative file paths and keeping javascript and CSS external is all part of 
			this. All of my pages use the same, external CSS.  All of my Javascript, CSS and
			Assets are kept in their respective directories. In the files where a lot of
			code is written out, indentation is used to make interpretation by another human 
			easier. I have commented my JavaScript so that it can be easily understood. Each
			part of the code is clearly labelled and obvious variable names are used. </p>
			<h2>Validation</h2>
			<p>These validation tools compare the webpages against the world wide web consortium
			standards</p>
			<h3>To Begin with, I used the Google "mobile-friendly Test"</h3>
			<img alt="mobilefrinedly" src="Assets/mobilefriend.jpg">
			<h3>Then I used the W3 'nu' validation tool.</h3>
			<img alt="cssval" src="Assets/cssval.jpg">
			<img alt="indexval" src="Assets/indexval.jpg">
			<img alt="contactval" src="Assets/contactval.jpg">
			<img alt="errorval" src="Assets/errorval.jpg">
			<p>All of these validation errors come from the embedded youtube video –
			where the code is from Google themselves. </p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>To conclude the website is dynamic and responsive. It uses CSS and JavaScript
			to make the interface more user-friendly. There is a customisation section where
			the user can design a hockey goalie mask using the canvas and change the colour 
			and weight of their drawing tool as well as save and load their designs from local
			storage. HTML5 and CSS3 elements have been used. The file structure used is the 
			one recommended to us. The website is operational across a wide range of browsers 
			and devices, although the canvas doesn’t work on mobile because the default 
			touchmove is to scroll the web page, not draw on the canvas. </p>
